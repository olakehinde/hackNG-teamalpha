Synopsis
=====
The objective here is to hack the biodata module of the TCN learning
management system. This app uses a node backend built with express 4
framework.

It uses sqlite as a sandbox database. We intend to use a full-fledged
SQL database for deployement: MySQL or POSTGRESql.

TODO
====
1. set up the dev environment. Ensure node modules binaries are installed
2. set up app architecture: routes, models, servers and specs
3. implement api end-points
4. carry out functional tests on api end-points.
